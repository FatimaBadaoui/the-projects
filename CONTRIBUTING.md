# Contributing to Transcriptase
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. First `Fork` this Repo to your Github account 
2. `Clone` the forked repo to your local machine
3. Create a new `branch` on your local machine
4. Make your changes and `commit` them to your local repo
5. `Push` your changes to your forked repo
6. Submit a `Pull Request` so that we can review your changes
7. Add a description to your `Pull Request` that explains your changes
8. If everything is ok, we will `merge` your `Pull Request` to the `main` branch

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Keep the code simple and clean.
* Keep the files and folders organized.
* For the CSS we like to use nested selectors.
* When is needed we use variables for colors, fonts, etc.
* We use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons but we are open to use other icon libraries.
* We are using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format our code.
* We are using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to check our code.
* We love to use [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
