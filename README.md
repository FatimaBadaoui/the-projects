## 01 - Countify | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/01-counterApp)
![Countify](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/assets/79191808/2ce1f722-76f8-4e39-9f94-eea4ab777a0f)

In this ***Counter*** application, developed using **Vanilla JavaScript**, we explore the utilization of the `querySelector` method to select elements within the **Document Object Model (DOM)** and the `addEventListener` method to respond to events, specifically the `click` event.

The tutorial also covers the process of incrementing or decrementing values, inserting these values into a specific DOM element, and dynamically altering the counter's color based on its value. When the value is less than zero, the color is set to a reddish tone, while for values greater than zero, a greenish hue is applied.

To achieve this functionality, we implement a `function` that employs conditional `if` statements to assess the counter value and adjust the color accordingly.

Finally, we gain insights into the creation of functions and their invocation as needed.

## 02 - Slider v.001 | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/02-slider-1)

***Slider*** developed using **Vanilla JavaScript**. 

In this project we went a bit further. We explore how to `export` and `import` data from an external file and how we can insert this data into the DOM using the `textContent` property.

Also, we learn how to create random numbers using the `Math.random()`, one of the most common and useful methods in JavaScript.

## 3 - Password Generator | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/03-passGen)
![passGen](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/assets/79191808/7f544902-3f90-460e-9d9b-98a7ae8cb7ea)

Powerfull ***Password Generator*** developed using **Vanilla JavaScript**.

In this project we went a bit further with the `Math.random()` method to generate random numbers and how to deal with `input` values like `range` and `checkbox`.

At the end, we also learned how to copy a text to the clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` method and a we had first approach to `setTimout()` method.

## 4 - Gradient Generator | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/04-gradientGen)
![Gradient Gen](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/assets/79191808/0dedc481-b072-42ea-b479-377390dd6aaa)

In this project we explore the `linear-gradient()` method to create a gradient background and how to use the `input` element to change the gradient colors. 

We also learned how to create a function to generate random hex colors and how to use the `Math.random()` method.

## 5 - To-Do App *(with localStorage)* | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/05-todoApp)
![todogithub](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/assets/79191808/68497608-0c58-41d3-b6f7-296d879e133a)

*To-Do App* developed using **Vanilla JavaScript**. In this project we learn how to use the `localStorage` method to store and retrieve data from the browser.

We also learn how to use `matches`, `closest` and `contains` methods to respond to events.

## 6 - Countdown Timer | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/06-countdownTimer)
![countdown](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/assets/79191808/2b97d599-b073-4de5-971b-7b15ff17d7ee)

In this project we explore the `Date()` object and how to use it to create a countdown timer. Then we use `getTime()` method to get the current time in a way that we can use it to calculate the time left to the end of the countdown. 

We also learned in detail how to use the `setInterval()` method to update the countdown every second.

At the end we added some detail like `JSConfetti` library to make the countdown more fun when launched.

## 7 - Cookie Policy *(with CookieStorage & localStorage)*  | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/07-cookiePolicy)
![cookiePolicy](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/assets/79191808/3e73d2af-2347-42a0-8ab6-9cce04aa351f)

In this project we explore the `localStorage` and `CookieStorage` to create a cookie policy that will be stored in the browser and will be displayed only once. For this we use the `getItem()` and `setItem()` methods and the property `document.cookie`.

If the user accepts the cookie policy, we store it in the `CookieStorage`for 30 days, and we hide the cookie policy message. If the user doesn't accept the cookie policy, we store it in the `localStorage` and we hide the cookie policy message. In both cases, the cookie policy message will be displayed only once even if the user refresh the page.

## 8 - Words Counter Pro | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/08-wordsCounter)
![wordsCOunterPro](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/assets/79191808/f1511742-59ed-433a-af45-06e1d7bb2bf9)

This **Word Counter** is a comprehensive implementation using only **Vanilla JavaScript**. We explore updating various properties of multiple DOM elements simultaneously whenever the user inputs text into the `textarea`.

We also learn how to use the `split()` method to split a string into an array of substrings, and how to use the `filter()` method. We also explore the `forEach()` method to iterate over the array.

## 9 - BMI Calculator | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/09-bmiCalc)

![bmi](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/assets/79191808/20bfa560-31cb-49a8-b72f-c564af1fd4ef)

In this project we learn how to use the <code>parseInt</code> and <code>parseFloat</code> methods to convert strings to numbers and how to use the <code>toFixed</code> method to round numbers to a specific number of decimal places.

## 10 - StopWatch | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/10-stopwatch)

This **JavaScript** code creates a countdown timer with start, stop, and reset buttons using **Vanilla JavaScript**.

The `updateTimer()` function updates the display every second via `setInterval()`. User interactions trigger `start()`, `stop()`, and `reset()` functions to control the timer.
