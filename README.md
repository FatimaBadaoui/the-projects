## 01 - Countify | [:rocket: Go to Code](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/tree/main/01-counterApp)
![Countify](https://github.com/Pilag6/the-projects/assets/79191808/2ce1f722-76f8-4e39-9f94-eea4ab777a0f)

In this counter application, developed using **Vanilla JavaScript**, we explore the utilization of the `querySelector` method to select elements within the **Document Object Model (DOM)** and the `addEventListener` method to respond to events, specifically the `click` event.

The tutorial also covers the process of incrementing or decrementing values, inserting these values into a specific DOM element, and dynamically altering the counter's color based on its value. When the value is less than zero, the color is set to a reddish tone, while for values greater than zero, a greenish hue is applied.

To achieve this functionality, we implement a `function` that employs conditional `if` statements to assess the counter value and adjust the color accordingly.

Finally, we gain insights into the creation of functions and their invocation as needed.
